# Using Bootstrap

This is my solution to Microverse's seventh project. It is a clone of the Newsweek home page. The page is found [here](https://www.newsweek.com/). It is created using HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

A live version can be found [here](https://raw.githack.com/davidauza-engineer/Using-Bootstrap/home-page/index.html).
